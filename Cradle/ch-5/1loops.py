"""
loops are used to repeat instructions.
-while loops
-for looops

"""
#print hello n times
print("hellow")
print("hellow")
print("hellow")
print("hellow")
print("hellow")
#manually doing it n times will fill the files storage 
#plus code readability gets dicey

"""

--in case ofsome variable we are working with and a stopping condtition

for traverseing over some datatype [list,tup,str]
--in thiscase we use for loop
