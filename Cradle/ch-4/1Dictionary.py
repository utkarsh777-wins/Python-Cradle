# DICTIONARY IN PYTHON 
"""
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs
They are unordered, mutable(changeable) & don't allow duplicate keys
in-short: index doesn't exist

"key" : "value"

Values can be of any type: string, integer, float, boolean, list, tuple.
Keys can be of any immutable type, so basically all of the above, except list.
dict["name"], dict["huh], dict["score"]
dict["key"] = "value"   #to assign or add new
