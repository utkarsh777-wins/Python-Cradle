# '=' assignement opperator__helps assign variables, so age = 25 implies the value 25 was stored in a variable named 'age'
#  Rules for identifiers- A a 1 _, no special symbols in our variables, length is independent
#  simple, short, meaningful -varible names

name = "Utkarsh"    #string
age = 23    #int
price = 25.99   #float
print(type(name))
