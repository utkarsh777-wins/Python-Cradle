# indexing

"""

whenever a string is created in python
position counting starts [0-n]
spaces and special characteeres also get index
index helps us to access characters

"""
str1 = "indexing"
# ch = str1[0]
# print(ch)
print(str1[4])

# in the form of index we can only access character, cannot manipulate them directly
